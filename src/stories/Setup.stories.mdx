# Initial Configuration

## Environment variables
You'll most likely want to store your Auth0 and Dgraph data as environment
variables, i.e. in a `.env` file:

```shell
# Auth0
AUTH0_DOMAIN="---"
AUTH0_CLIENT="---"

# Dgraph Cloud
DGRAPH_DOMAIN="---"
DGRAPH_CLIENT="---"
```

## Add to `src/App`

Now, wrap your app with a `GqlUiProvider`:

```tsx
/**
 * Load from process.env. These variable names may vary depending on your setup
 * (i.e., you may need to use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefixes for domains on NextJS).
 */
const {
  AUTH0_DOMAIN,
  AUTH0_CLIENT,
  DGRAPH_DOMAIN,
  DGRAPH_CLIENT
} = process.env;

const config = {
  auth0: {
    domain: AUTH0_DOMAIN ?? '',
    clientKey: AUTH0_CLIENT ?? ''
  },
  dgraph: {
    domain: DGRAPH_DOMAIN ?? '',
    clientKey: DGRAPH_CLIENT ?? ''
  }
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <GqlUiProvider {...config}>
      {/* App contents */}
    </GqlUiProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This library's components will now be able to authenticate its requests to the
backend. This will also provide a configured Apollo Client to all children,
which can be accessed with `useApolloClient()`.
